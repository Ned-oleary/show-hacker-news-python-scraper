So, I wrote this web application, an MVP that allows you to ask a question (once a day) about the software architecture of a popular open-source project. You can ask about the current architecture or about how to enhance that architecture to accommodate new capabilities or to pay down specific forms of tech debt.<p>Here is the list of open-source projects that have already been indexed: Cassandra, Debezium, Druid, Elastic Search, Lucene, Kafka, Neo4j, and Spark. Are there other open-source projects you would instead ask software architecture questions about? Feel free to post a comment about them or upvote another comment that already lists them.<p>The pipeline behind this app is compute-intensive. This project is self-funded and on a considerably lean budget. Waiting for the answer to your question would not be a good experience. There is no signup, but I do require an email address to verify that the question comes from you and to receive the answer. Outside of that, I have no interest in your email, so feel free to use a temporary email service such as Mailinator if you feel uncomfortable with providing your real email address.<p>This is a learning adventure for me, so I look forward to your feedback, especially regarding any hallucinations in the answer to your question.

- Magic inbox to send invoices and receipts which get automatically matched and filed
- Access to over 14,500 banks in the US and Europe via Plaid &amp; Gocardless
- Deep integration with Google Sheets which allows to e.g.
    - Sync your trial balance to a sheet. Awesome for reporting, financial modelling or advanced workflows
    - Load accruals from Google Sheets safely and easily. Allows complicated schedules and makes adjusting them super easy
- Integrated accounting copilot with access to your ledger. It can give you meaningful insights into your financials and make entries.

I think of it as digital sticky notes. The goal was to make notes with a personal touch that are easy to write and share. I also wanted them to appear as their own link preview image on supported platforms. That way when you send the link to a note, the person sees the message without following the link.<p>Let me know what you think!<p>I drew inspiration from Apple&#x27;s quick notes: low latency made scribbling a pleasure, and sending notes to friends felt warm and original compared to a typical exchange. It was also intriguing to see my handwriting printed in a message chat. In a time of rising artificial generation, spreading my clumsy handwriting feels like an act of rebellion.<p>But I dislike the light background in Apple notes, which I don&#x27;t think you can change when sharing. More importantly, no one sent a note back. With fingernotes the low-friction interaction is meant to make creating notes simple. I also find the image previews aesthetically more pleasing.<p>For implementation, fingernotes are publicly accessible links to collections of strokes that have been persisted to a Cloudflare D1 database and rendered in SVG. Like pen on a sticky note, each stroke is immutable but anyone can add to a note if they have the link. You can&#x27;t undo strokes, so if you mess up your note just throw it out and start a new one. Having append-only collections avoids handling order of operations when multiple people edit the same note. Hosting it as a Cloudflare worker made it easy to get up and running.

False,"Show HN: NailGenie - Edit nail designs conversationally with AI<p>I built NailGenie (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nailgenie.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nailgenie.org</a>) to solve the &quot;that&#x27;s not what I meant&quot; problem in nail design. It&#x27;s an AI platform that lets you iteratively edit nail art through simple conversation rather than static generation.<p>THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE<p>The core challenge was building a system that could understand contextual, incremental editing commands for a specific visual domain. Most generative AI solutions focus on one-shot generation, not a continuing dialogue about the same image.<p>We solved this by:<p>1. Fine-tuning Gemini on a dataset of nail designs with paired editing instructions<p>2. Building a stateful context management system to track editing history<p>3. Creating a visual diffing algorithm that preserves nail boundaries during edits<p>4. Implementing an instruction parser that handles ambiguous editing requests<p>The backend reaches ~98% instruction comprehension on our test set and produces edits in ~2.7 seconds on average.<p>TECH STACK<p>- Frontend: Next.js App Router with TypeScript and React Server Components<p>- UI: Shadcn&#x2F;UI + TailwindCSS (we chose these for rapid iteration)<p>- Backend: Supabase for authentication, storing edit history, and managing user credits<p>- Deployment: Vercel edge functions for low-latency API responses<p>- AI: Custom-tuned Gemini models with a multi-stage processing pipeline<p>DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND LEARNINGS<p>The biggest challenges were:<p>1. Instruction ambiguity: &quot;Make it more pink&quot; means different things to different users. We implemented a clarification system that refines ambiguous requests.<p>2. Edge detection: Early versions struggled with nail boundaries. We built a specialized segmentation model to ensure edits only affected the nail area.<p>3. Performance: Initial processing was ~8s per edit. We optimized by parallelizing our pipeline and caching intermediate representations, cutting time by ~65%.<p>4. Cold starts: Edge function cold starts were killing the experience. We implemented background warmers and optimized model loading.<p>THE WHY AND WHAT&#x27;S NEXT<p>I&#x27;m not a nail expert, but I noticed my girlfriend spending hours browsing examples before salon visits, then being frustrated when the result didn&#x27;t match her vision. The challenge of creating a system that bridges this communication gap became technically fascinating.<p>Current metrics:
- ~450 users in closed beta<p>- Average session: 8.3 edits per design<p>- 82% completion rate (users reaching a final saved design)<p>FUTURE PLANS<p>- Open source our instruction parsing logic next month<p>- Add API access for nail salons to integrate directly<p>- Implement real-time collaborative editing<p>TRY IT YOURSELF<p>NailGenie is live with free starter credits.

So I am building my own. Especially rewatches or rereads are really mid on the existing sites.<p>Been pretty fun, im up to like 175 registered users from some reddit posts, but its still early on.<p>Its built with c# in the backend, and the new react router 7 in framework mode on the frontend. Pretty happy that the timing aligned and I wasnt forced into NextJs for SSR &#x2F; SEO purposes. RR7 has been a much better experience. It just works and gets out of your way.<p>The more im in this space, the worse the existing websites seem. Even Imdb. Why dont I see related titles when I check out The Dark Knight? Why dont I see its part of a trilogy? Why dont I see other batman movies? Why dont I see the gotham tv show anywhere? Just seems weird for an entertainment site.

False,"Hi HN<p>I posted a couple of months ago on building a low code AI ML platform, and since then I&#x27;ve baked in a lot of new stuff. First of all, what is otto-m8? The best way to think about it is its a low code platform that let&#x27;s you visually create AI&#x2F;ML based workflows by treating building AI&#x2F;ML flows as a graph problem. Every tech meetup I attend, I&#x27;ve been seeing everyone demo-ing their workflow via what looks like a graph or flowchart. Hence why I decided to give it a shot and make those flowcharts do something.<p>What has changed since my last post?
I added the ability for devs to alter an implementation of a block, which essentially helps you do two things:<p>- create custom blocks from scratch, or<p>- not be limited to what I have implemented.<p>Furthermore, I added features for LLM memory, saving drafts, testing workflows on the fly without having to deploy it(kind of mimics a real life dev workflow with instant feedbacks on your changes), a GCloud integration and many more.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of Langflow and some other startups working on the same problem space(and how could one forget n8n, from whom this project was inspired). The way I like to think of otto-m8 is that it is not built on top of any frameworks like Langchain which most of these low code platforms are built on top of. This gives developers the flexibility to not implement or be tied to Langchain if they don&#x27;t want to while conversely allowing them to use Langchain if they want to. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing but I like to personally just implement the cookie cutter OpenAI API starter code, and iterate.<p>It&#x27;s not fully worked on yet, and hence why its open source- there&#x27;s only so much I could do alone.

It&#x27;s designed as a fast, transactional key-value storage engine built on a log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture.<p>My journey with TidesDB began nearly 2 years ago whilst I was experimenting with various data structures and databases in Go. When I encountered the log-structured merge tree concept, I was initially overwhelmed by its complexity after reviewing other implementations.<p>However, after studying the original paper, I realized I could potentially simplify the design by focusing on just a 2-level approach(memory level and a disk level). This was challenging at first, and I scrapped many ideas along the way, but over time I discovered how powerful this design could potentially be.<p>The beauty of this design&#x2F;architecture is its extensibility. Since the disk level contains many SSTables (Sorted String Tables), we can efficiently pair and merge them in various ways - whether in parallel for speed or incrementally to minimize resource impact.<p>What began as a challenging learning process has I believed evolved into a unique engine design and library.<p>You can check out TidesDB code here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidesdb&#x2F;tidesdb"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tidesdb&#x2F;tidesdb</a><p>Website here (Architecture-design, documentation and more): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tidesdb.com</a><p>There are a variety of FFI libraries in the works for C++, GO, Python, Lua and more!<p>Currently TidesDB is nearing its first major release, we are still in beta development.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your thoughts, questions and all :)",22,story,1742554828,alexpadula,Show HN: A Database Written in C,9,https://github.com/tidesdb/tidesdb,43434167,"[43436047, 43436678, 43435084]"

It also adds security (authentication) and encryption of traffic with TLS.<p>To run GizmoSQL - see the steps in the README.md - where you can see how easy it is to run the server as well as how to connect via ADBC and JDBC from a remote client - such as DBeaver, Python, etc.  The easiest way to run GizmoSQL is via Docker - but there are downloads for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 platforms (download links in the README).<p>Why?:
As you may know, DuckDB and SQLite are embedded systems - they don&#x27;t enable client connectivity, and they aren&#x27;t really designed for concurrency.<p>I&#x27;ve built GizmoSQL to work around that - because I believe the DuckDB engine is very powerful, and I feel like a lot of customers overpay and run distributed compute (i.e. Spark) when they don&#x27;t really need to.  Making it easy to have remote connectivity to DuckDB can make it easier to migrate SQL workloads from Spark or other expensive commercial platforms to this engine - with a much simpler architecture&#x2F;infrastructure.<p>It is my intention to make GizmoSQL a commercial product - licensed for production use by organizations, but free for developers to code with - evaluate, and test.<p>A little bit of backstory:
* I built the initial version of this while working for a former employer - it wasn&#x27;t their core focus, so they open-sourced that early version.  After I left there, I forked the product and have improved it substantially - to support concurrency of both reads and writes, improving security, as well as keeping it up to date with the latest versions of Apache Arrow and DuckDB.<p>* This project evolved from a prototype created by the brilliant Tom Drabas.<p>* It feels a little weird trying to make a commercial product based upon DuckDB, but MotherDuck started it :P - and I&#x27;ve contributed (albeit very little) to the DuckDB and Apache Arrow projects in the form of a couple of PRs.<p>I&#x27;m really excited about this project - I have run benchmarks of this product against commercial platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks SQL - and it holds its own running the 22-query TPC-H SF1TB benchmark, especially on cost.

False,"Hi HN! I’m Tony, co-founder of Inngest. I wanted to share AgentKit, our Typescript multi-agent library we’ve been cooking and testing with some early users in prod for months.<p>Although  OpenAI’s Agents SDK has been launched since, we think an Agent framework should offer more deterministic and flexible routing, work with multiple model providers, embrace MCP (for rich tooling), and support the unstoppable and growing community of TypeScript AI developers by enabling a smooth transition to production use cases.<p>This is why we are building AgentKit, and we’re really excited about it for a few reasons:<p>Firstly, it’s simple. We embrace KISS principles brought by Anthropic and HuggingFace by allowing you to gradually add autonomy to your AgentKit program using primitives:<p>- Agents: LLM calls that can be combined with prompts, tools, and MCP native support.<p>- Networks: a simple way to get Agents to collaborate with a shared State, including handoff.<p>- State: combines conversation history with a fully typed state machine, used in routing.<p>- Routers: where the autonomy lives, from code-based to LLM-based (ex: ReAct) orchestration<p>The routers are where the magic happens, and allow you to build deterministic, reliable, testable agents.<p>AgentKit routing works as follows: the network calls itself in a loop, inspecting the State to determine which agents to call next using a router.  The returned agent runs, then optionally updates state data using its tools.  On the next loop, the network inspects state data and conversation history, and determines which new agent to run.<p>This fully typed state machine routing allows you to deterministically build agents using any of the effective agent patterns — which means your code is easy to read, edit, understand, and debug.<p>This also makes handoff incredibly easy: you define when agents should hand off to each other using regular code and state (or by calling an LLM in the router for AI-based routing). This is similar to the OpenAI Agents SDK but easier to manage, plan, and build.<p>Then comes the local development and moving to production capabilities.<p>AgentKit is compatible with Inngest’s tooling, meaning that you can test agents using Inngest’s local DevServer, which provides traces, inputs, outputs, replay, tool, and MCP inputs and outputs, and (soon) a step-over debugger so that you can easily understand and visually see what&#x27;s happening in the agent loop.<p>In production, you can also optionally combine AgentKit with Inngest for fault-tolerant execution.  Each agent’s LLM call is wrapped in a step, and tools can use multiple steps to incorporate things like human-in-the-loop.  This gives you native orchestration, observability, and out-of-the-box scale.<p>You will find the documentation as an example of an AgentKit SWE-bench and multiple Coding Agent examples.<p>It’s fully open-source under the Apache 2 license.<p>If you want to get started:<p>- npm: npm i @inngest&#x2F;agent-kit<p>- GitHub: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inngest&#x2F;agent-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inngest&#x2F;agent-kit</a><p>- Docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentkit.inngest.com&#x2F;overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentkit.inngest.com&#x2F;overview</a><p>We’re excited to finally launch AgentKit; let us know what you think!",15,story,1742491666,tonyhb,Show HN: AgentKit – JavaScript Alternative to OpenAI Agents SDK with Native MCP,64,https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit,43426164,"[43428356, 43438585, 43441642, 43426702, 43426822, 43427446, 43427118, 43428557, 43427613, 43426427]"

False,"Hi Hackers,<p>My wife and I have been slow traveling around the world for last 3 years, and our top travel hack that has saved us most amount of money is to book directly with Airbnb host. We usually rent for a month so savings in fees are easily ~$300 - $500 on each stay, i.e. about 15-20%. Not every host offers it we respect that, but there are so many hosts out there that would rather have you book directly via their website and we as guests want the same. The problem is these hosts can’t promote or say that on Airbnb.<p>This inspired me to build OpenBnB.org, where I’ve started collecting direct booking websites of hosts. So far, I have around 1,500 hosts representing 150,000 listings – most of them in USA. The idea is to give guests more options to book, and hosts another channel to distribute their listings.<p>The first solution is a browser extension that makes it really easy to find the direct booking website of hosts when you’re browsing Airbnb. It just a one-time easy install with no sign ups. It:
1) highlights all the directly-bookable listings on the search page,
2) lets you search listings only from hosts with direct booking option and then of course
3) gives you the direct booking link on the listing page.
What I like about this solution is it doesn’t require guests to go to a different website; they can just browse Airbnb (largest inventory of short-term rentals) as usual and get more options to book when available.<p>Other than savings, I think there is something about the direct relationship with hosts and guests, without any intermediaries. 
The cool think is I estimate about 20-33% of Airbnbs can be booked directly! That means I’ve only collected around 6 to 9% of all directly-bookable listings around the world.<p>I’ve seen some other chrome extensions do something similar, but none of them highlight these listings nor let you search listings only with hosts that offer direct booking.<p>What do you think? Try it out and let me know if this is useful. I’m also planning to spin up a website that only has listings from these hosts, kind of like a meta-search engine for vacation rental websites.",6,story,1742414857,anikethanda,Show HN: I built an extension to book Airbnbs directly,8,https://www.openbnb.org/,43416697,"[43418131, 43418347, 43417153, 43423376]"

False,"When copying or resizing between buffered images, doing multiple calls to drawImage() can be preferable to a single call on the destination image&#x27;s graphics.<p>The most obvious reason is speed-up with parallelization, using multiple destination graphics with exclusive clips, and one drawImage() call per graphics. This can cause slight inaccuracies due to how clipping is handled, and might actually slow things down, possibly a lot, depending on image types, for example due to locks in images internals or due to slower clipped images processing paths. With the most efficiently supported image types though, such as INT_XXX and BYTE_GRAY, it&#x27;s often well worth it.<p>Another reason is speed-up and&#x2F;or accuracy improvement by using intermediary image types, because for some combinations of source and destination image types drawImage() can be very slow and&#x2F;or inaccurate.<p>For example, when copying from INT_ARGB_PRE to BYTE_BINARY, the resulting intensity is not appropriate due to a same coefficient being used for each R&#x2F;G&#x2F;B component. This can be mostly fixed by first copying to BYTE_GRAY, which also speeds things up. Adding intermediary INT_ARGB images on each side of the BYTE_GRAY image further increases the accuracy and the speed of the overall process.<p>Another example is upscaling an image by just a factor 2 while converting from BYTE_ABGR_PRE to a CUSTOM type (like INT_ABGR_PRE): using INT_ARGB_PRE intermediary images as source and destination for the resize operation can speed up the overall process by a factor of 7 sequentially, or 20 in parallel on a 8-core when using NEAREST, or by a factor of 2 to 7 when using BICUBIC.<p>A third reason is cache misses: when copying between multiple intermediary image types (which, as we saw, can be useful when converting to BYTE_BINARY), rather than copying the whole image to each new type, it&#x27;s better to go through all the types slice per slice, for the pixels written at one step to still be in cache when being written into the next image.<p>Maintaining slices through resizing should also be possible, but it would be more tricky and require enlarged source slices, as resizing algorithms typically use surrounding pixels. At this point it would probably be better instead to optimize drawImage() internals, although that would only apply to newer JDK versions.<p>I made this library to take care of these kinds of optimizations:

It also implements BOXSAMPLED algorithm.<p>Its API is similar to that of Thumbnailator&#x27;s Resizer interface, in that it takes source and destination buffered images as arguments, so it is straightforward to implement Resizer on top of it.<p>I also added support for parallelism in a Thumbnailator fork, by adding ThumbnailMaker.parallel(Executor), ParallelResizer interface and implementations of it for usual algorithms:

It should give kids a safe space to explore (even if they can&#x27;t spell or type) with restrictions that evolve as they mature. It should be so great they want to keep using it even as adults.<p>Kindredly aims to be the best solution for families and individuals who care about privacy and want to regain control over their data.<p>Features:<p>- Private Family Posts – Share securely with only your family—your own private social network.
- Organized, Not Just Stored – A structured way to keep meaningful content.
- Parental Controls – Kids can only access approved content and sites via the Kindredly app or browser extension. Time limits included.

Enter <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatimages.online"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatimages.online</a> Here is how it went.<p>So, it is no secret how terrible image editing on phones is, especially if you do not own the cutting edge phones, or even in some cutting edge phones, (apple I&#x27;m looking at you) the experience is still terrible.<p>Even so, if you are on pc or mac, you may still need to know or learn some tool to get the work done. In many cases the learning curve is directly proportional to the functionality offered, i.e., the harder it is to learn the more the functionality and vice versa. How about we make it the other way around, just a simple chat interface packing quite a number of functionality, with AI doing a lot of the heavy lifting.<p>So we got to work. Building an intuitive chat-based editor seemed almost impossible, especially with a budget under $50. But somehow—I&#x27;m still amazed how everything came together. We managed to pull off something pretty remarkable.<p>Here&#x27;s what we built:<p>- A chat-based image editor you interact with naturally to handle tasks like background replacements, object removals, adding new elements, or even changing an object&#x27;s color and properties.<p>- Edit poses, relight scenes, expand images, upscale images, restyle images, restore old images, face retouch, virtual try-ons and many many more image editing tasks you can think of.<p>- You can also create images directly from the chat, you can train on your own images and create professional headshots, brand assets e.t.c you can also create posters with the best texts on images in the market now (still hallucinates sometimes but far much better than most other services)<p>- Tech stack involves Next.js for the frontend, Convex backend, Polar for payment processing, PostHog for analytics, and AI SDK for agent orchestration.<p>- Most exciting is our agent-based workflow, which after testing, we found consistently offers image edits that are genuinely better than Apple&#x27;s built-in features and many other services of the same kind.<p>The big advantage is you no longer need high-end hardware to access cutting-edge image editing: just open your browser and start chatting.<p>Now here’s the kicker—I did this with a team of one, from Kenya, and on a budget under $50 (thanks partly to some provider coupons).

Unlike existing solutions, Zant focuses on performance, portability, and ease of integration, making it a strong alternative for anyone working on Edge AI and embedded ML.<p>Why Zant?<p>Most TinyML frameworks are either too high-level (requiring bloated runtimes) or too low-level (requiring extensive manual optimization). Zant bridges the gap by offering:
- A lightweight but powerful code generation system to translate ML models into optimized C&#x2F;Zig code.
- Better memory efficiency than Python-based tools like TensorFlow Lite Micro.
- No runtime overhead—all computations are optimized for the target hardware.
- A modern, memory-safe approach using Zig instead of C&#x2F;C++.<p>Features:<p>- Code generation now supports 29 operations, including: GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication), Convolutions (Conv2D), Activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, Leaky ReLU, and more
- Over 150 tests ensuring correctness and robustness across different hardware targets
- A fuzzing system helps detect mathematical errors and verify the integrity of auto-generated code.<p>Zant supports fully connected networks and simple convolutional architectures, making it suitable for various real-world TinyML applications.<p>Supported Hardware:<p>Zant has already been tested on multiple embedded platforms, showing promising results in real-world deployment:
Raspberry Pi Pico (1 &amp; 2) 
STM32 G4 and H7 
Arduino Giga
Seeed Camera
More devices are being added as testing expands.<p>Roadmap:<p>Zant is still in early development, but we have ambitious goals for the next versions:
Expanding code generation to cover more ML operations.
- Quantization support (already in progress) to reduce model size and improve efficiency.
- YOLO support for real-time object detection on microcontrollers.
- Simplified deployment workflows to make it easier to use Zant across different hardware platforms.
- CI&#x2F;CD pipeline to improve reliability and automate testing.
- Community engagement with a Telegram&#x2F;Discord channel launching soon.<p>Why Zig?<p>Zig provides a modern, safer alternative to C, with better memory safety and performance optimizations. Unlike Python-based ML tools, Zant’s Zig-based approach avoids runtime overhead, making it ideal for low-power embedded devices.<p>How to Get Involved:<p>If you’re interested in TinyML, Edge AI, or embedded development, we’d love your feedback and contributions!

False,"Hey HN!<p>I built Make 10, a quick, brain-teasing puzzle game where you combine numbers and operators to create an expression that equals 10. It’s simple to learn but surprisingly challenging, requiring both logic and creativity.<p>How It Works
- You’re given a set of numbers (e.g., 4, 6, 3, 4).  
- Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses to form an equation that equals 10.
- Use all given numbers exactly once.
- Submit your answer and keep your streak alive!
- A new puzzle is available every day.
- Sidebar to toggle between game modes<p>Inspiration
It’s inspired by a mental math game played on trains in Sydney, Australia. Passengers would challenge each other to make 0 using the numbers on their carriage number. I realized this simple concept could make a fun, daily brain teaser for everyone since it already has many real world users!<p>&quot;Make X&quot; Mode!
Make X is an expanded challenge mode that takes the Make 10 formula and makes it more unpredictable and varied.<p>How &quot;Make X&quot; Works
- Instead of always making 10, the target number varies
- Uses a Countdown-style challenge with bigger numbers for extra difficulty (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 100).
- Solve puzzles with a drag-and-drop expression builder.<p>Why Play?
Quick &amp; Addictive – A great mental warm-up in just a few minutes.
Fun for all ages and skill levels – Casual players and math lovers alike will enjoy it.
New challenges every day – Keep improving your skills.

If you&#x27;ve ever had to upgrade dependencies, refactor thousands of files, or apply the same fix across multiple repos, you know how painful and time-consuming it can be. Hypermod makes this process faster and more reliable by combining static analysis, AI-powered codemods, and GitHub automation.<p>Why I Built This<p>I&#x27;ve spent years working with large codebases where upgrading dependencies or migrating frameworks was a nightmare—lots of manual work, brittle scripts, and coordination across teams. Existing tools like codemods and regex-based find-and-replace help, but they often fall short when dealing with complex transformations across multiple repositories. I wanted something that could automate the entire process while integrating directly into CI&#x2F;CD.<p>What’s Different<p>- Works in a GitHub Action: Unlike other tools that clone your repo to an external server, Hypermod runs directly in a GitHub Action, keeping everything secure and within your workflow.
- AI-Powered Codemods: Generate migration scripts automatically based on before&#x2F;after code samples.
- Multi-Repo Support: Apply transformations across multiple repositories at scale.
- Customizable Transformations: Use static analysis and AST-based codemods to apply complex changes reliably.
- Safe &amp; Auditable: All changes go through Git, so you can review and test before merging.<p>Try It Out<p>You can test it out in our sandbox editor without signing up.

In addition to letting you visualize travel isochrones on the homepage, OpenTimes also lets you download massive amounts of travel time data for free and with no limits.<p>The primary goal here is to enable research and fill a gap I noticed in the open-source spatial ecosystem.

After becoming a full time Magento consultant in 2011, I&#x27;ve being a maintainer for OpenMage for 3.5 years and then started a new project based on that beautiful platform that, I believe, still has a lot to say.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick overview of Maho, from August 2024 to our release just a few days ago.<p>Philosophy<p><pre><code>  - Leveraging M1&#x27;s core strengths while removing the technical debt
  - Ditching outdated dependencies and optimizing for today&#x27;s web standards
  - Clean project structure with proper dependency management via Composer
  - Embracing modern PHP (8.2+) and contemporary frontend practices
</code></pre>
Technical Highlights<p><pre><code>  - Composer-based project structure with full autoload support, no longer you&#x27;ll have any part of the core in your project&#x27;s folder&#x2F;repository
  - No prototypejs nor jQuery not ExtJS on the frontend (backend is work in progress
  - Native support for AVIF and WebP formats with one-click media storage conversion
  - 2FA and PassKey support for the backend
  - Self-hosted GDPR-compliant captcha module
  - Full SMTP support thanks to symfony&#x2F;mailer, connect to all major email services like SES, Azure, Mandrill, SendGrid
  - Updated frontend layout: retina ready, flexbox, CSS variables, better accessibility via rem units and proper touch target, huge reduction in javascript weight
  - Extended usage of SVG with a built-in 5800+ optimized SVG icons library based on tabler&#x2F;icons, easily includable in phtml files and customizable (stroke&#x2F;color&#x2F;size) via CSS
  - Built-in extensible CLI tool (Laravel&#x27;s Artisan style, based on symfony&#x2F;console)
</code></pre>
Where Maho Fits in the Ecommerce Landscape<p><pre><code>  - Magento2&#x2F;MageOS: Great for large or enterprise on-premise projects
  - Maho: Perfect for medium-to-small on-premise projects looking for a modern, streamlined platform
  - OpenMage: Good fit for more conservative projects
  - Shopify: Best for medium-to-small SaaS projects
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d love for you to give Maho a try in the hope to see our project grow with time.

I was tired of doom-scrolling and thought, &quot;What if an app could keep me informed while making me laugh?&quot;<p>What it does: AI Satire News takes real news stories and transforms them using different comedic personalities. Want to see how &quot;The Onion&quot; would cover tech layoffs? Or how a &quot;Gen Z Brainrot&quot; would explain inflation? Or even how &quot;Bob Ross&quot; would gently narrate geopolitical conflicts? The app handles it all.<p>I built a system that:<p>1. Ingests news from multiple sources in real-time
2. Uses specialized LLM prompting with personality-specific templates (all 11 personalities have different prompt structures)
3. Implements a multi-stage generation pipeline where headlines are created, voted on, and then full articles are generated based on the winning headline
4. Creates an interactive comment section where personalities argue with each other<p>Some unique features:
- Each personality has a specific role - some are &quot;posters&quot; who create full articles (like The Onion, Gen Z Brainrot, and Bob Ross), while others are &quot;commenters&quot; who react to articles
- Personalities like &quot;Conspiracy Grandma,&quot; &quot;Tech Bro Disruptor,&quot; and &quot;Pedantic Corrector&quot; will comment on articles and even reply to each other&#x27;s comments with their unique perspectives
- Comments include reactions (agree, disagree, shocked, amused) from other personalities
- The entire system creates a simulated social media experience where AI personalities interact with each other in entertaining ways<p>Some technical challenges I solved:
- Prompt engineering to make these AI more entertaining
- Prompt engineering to maintain each personality&#x27;s voice while preserving factual accuracy
- Building a real-time processing queue that scales with news volume
- Creating natural-sounding interactions between different AI personalities in the comments
- Keeping costs manageable while processing realtime news stories every hour<p>The app is completely free and has no ads.
